# DAILY SALES REPORT - Power BI Dashboard

This dashboard was developed to showcase the daily sales of the company across its different business regions. It portrayed the company's daily sales generated, number of dealers committed, number of people engaged in the company's produced app services - usage of the app and the sales generated through such engagement on daily basis, the quantity ordered for the company's products and their daily sale price tracks, and so on. The dashboard provides a clear and engaging insight to the company's real-time performance and sales.

Using Power BI to model the received MS Excel data files, this dashboard has been created using various 'measures' and data visualization tools.
